\section{Introduction} \label{sec:intro}
Within the Robotics and Intelligence systems module groups worked together to implement different behaviours with an E-Puck. Many different behaviours were available for implementation, including attraction, hate and aggression.

This report will explain, in detail, the tasks set out before each group. It will progress by explaining the design established to tackle these objectives, the implementation of the design, testing and results before concluding the coursework and evaluating the groups achievements.

The tasks given to each group were split into two separate parts. The first was to develop a behaviour on a single E-Puck. Such initial behaviours proposed by Dr. Meng, included love where the E-Puck would follow close to, but without touching, an object or, obstacle avoidance, where the E-Puck would try to avoid objects. More of the behaviours will be spoken about throughout this report in greater detail.

The second task included using two E-Pucks. One of the E-Pucks was tasked with following a human hand but not other objects, whilst the other was to follow the first E-Puck closely without touching it. This second E-Puck would imitate the love behaviour spoken about previously.
